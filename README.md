**Installation**

Libraries used were part of the standard libraries that came from the Anaconda distribution of Python:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- MatPlotLib

**Project Motivation**

For this project, I was personally interestested in the 120-year Summer Olympics (or just 'Olympics') data from 1896 to 2016 to better understand:
- Had the Summer Olympics always been gender-balanced?
- How long did it take to make the transition from then male-dominated events?
- Which sports contributed to the rise of female sports events?
- Which countries first started to support their female athletes to compete in the Olympics?

**File Descriptions**

There are 2 data files and 1 Jupyter notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions. 
- Data/athlete_events.csv: Each row corresponds to an individual athlete competing in an individual Olympic event.
- Data/noc_regions.csv: Each row describes the name of the country based on the initials.
- SummerOlympicsDataAnalytics: Jupyter Notebook that performs the necessary analyses.

The notebook is exploratory in analyzing the data in relation to the questions above. Various sections were labelled using markdown cells in the notebook to help walkthrough thought process.

**Results**

The key findings of this analysis are:
- Key finding 1
- Key finding 2
- Key finding 3
